## Laravel 4.0 Application - Pet Flyer generator

### Features

This is the source of http://missingpetflyer.com that is deployed to Pagodabox.

This application allows the users to upload a picture of a missing pet and create a poster of missing pet with custom text, without using MS Word or other poster making tools. 

It works on mobile - iOS 6 and Android devices and allows cropping of images by selecting the area of the image before previewing the poster.
